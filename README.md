# Netflix - Clone 
This application is a Netflix Clone, in which the user can register and log into his account. Also inside the application, the user can save movies.
When the user is logged into the account, all the movies that have been added to favorites are displayed in the upper right corner of the page.


This app was created by Firebase, so we have limited registration time, but in any case you can use the email and password Icreated before.
